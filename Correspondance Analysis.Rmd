Correspondence Analysis is similar with the PCA analysis, however, the difference is that correspoondence analysis is used when the response variable is categorical data.

With correspondence analysis, we could reduce the multiple variable two-way contigency table into two way visual. 
```{r}

library(ca)
data("smoke")
ca(smoke)
plot(ca(smoke, supcol = 1))
plot.ca(ca(smoke, supcol = 1))
plot(ca(smoke), mass = TRUE, contrib = "absolute",
map = "rowgreen", arrows = c(FALSE, TRUE))

```
